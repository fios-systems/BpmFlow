"It must remove the user from the role ONLY.

If NOT there is a problem. Case:

    Let say 10 grants are imported (one fail)
    Because there are still 9 valid grants on the system then:

    * Environment can be NOT removed
    * Application can NOT be removed
    * Role can NOT be removed

    Otherwise while removing the object an error will arise."
